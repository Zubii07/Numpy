# 📊 NumPy Learning & Practice

Welcome to my NumPy learning repository! This README serves as a quick revision guide and reference for my journey through **NumPy** — a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.

## 🧠 What is NumPy?

**NumPy (Numerical Python)** is a Python library used for:
- Efficient array computations
- Multidimensional array objects
- Mathematical functions, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and more


## 🧪 Practice Problems

### 🔹 Basic Challenges
1. Create an array of even numbers between 2 and 20
2. Reshape a 1D array into 2D
3. Perform element-wise operations on arrays
4. Find max value and its index in an array
5. Filter values using Boolean indexing

### 🔹 Intermediate Challenges
1. Normalize a NumPy array
2. Replace odd numbers with -1 (vectorized)
3. Find common elements between arrays
4. Create a matrix using `np.tile` 
5. Extract rows based on column condition
